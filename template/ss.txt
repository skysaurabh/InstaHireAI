The bag-of-words model is a way of representing text data when modeling text with machine learning algorithms.
A problem with modeling text is that it is messy, and techniques like machine learning algorithms prefer well defined fixed-length inputs and outputs.
Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly; the text must be converted into numbers. Specifically, vectors of numbers.
This is called feature extraction or feature encoding.
A popular and simple method of feature extraction with text data is called the bag-of-words model of text.

A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:

A vocabulary of known words.
A measure of the presence of known words.

So here we can see a sample code for bag of words using the gensim library.
The preview of sample preprocessed document shows that the word 23 analysi has appeared one time and the word 83 face has also appeared one time.

slide 15
So now first of all we are running LDA using the bag of words,
so here we are training our model using gensim.models.LdaMulticore and then we will besave our model.

For each topic, we will explore the words occuring in that topic and its relative weight.

No after running LDA using bag of words, we will be doing performance evaluation using LDA bag of words.
